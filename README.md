# CGAN-bedrock-seismic-IMs
In this project, Conditional GAN ( CGAN ) is used to predict the multi-dimensional variables of bedrock. The model uses random white noise as input and combines conditional parameters to predict the values of 24 target variables.
The following packages are required:
Python 3.12
PyTorch 2.7.0+cu118
NumPy
Pandas
